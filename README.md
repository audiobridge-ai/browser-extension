# AudioBridge Browser Extension

AudioBridge is a browser extension that helps transcribe user-owned audio files
using user-provided OpenAI APIs, giving users more flexibility over how their recordings
are converted into text.

## What AudioBridge Does

AudioBridge allows users to:

- Transcribe audio recordings they own using their own OpenAI API keys
- Work with audio files generated by supported recording devices
- Keep transcripts organized alongside existing recordings
- Maintain full control over their data and API usage
- Avoid vendor lock-in for transcription workflows

This project is currently in an early stage, and feedback is highly appreciated.

## Supported Audio Sources

- Audio files generated by supported recording devices
- Standard audio formats such as `mp3`, `wav`, and `m4a`

More sources may be supported in the future.

---

## How It Works

1. The user selects an audio file they own
2. The extension sends the audio file to a transcription service using the user's own API key
3. The resulting transcript is made available alongside the original recording

AudioBridge does not provide any built-in transcription service.
